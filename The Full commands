show ip interface breif 
"show int trunk"

Whats wrong 
"show etherchannel summary" first test on all switchs 
1)  Po1(SD) LACP   Gig0/1(I) Gig0/2(I) needs to be protocol. 
S3 
2)wrong protocol need to fix all of them 
Po1(SD)           PAgP   Gig0/1(I) Gig0/2(I) 
Po4(SD)           PAgP   Fa0/23(I) Fa0/24(I) 
Po6(SD)           PAgP   Fa0/21(I) Fa0/22(I)
